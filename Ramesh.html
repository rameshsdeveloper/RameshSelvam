            <h2>About Me and Work Experience</h2>
            <h2>Junior Software Engineer(2021 - 2023)</h1>
                <p>I've worked with Vaken Technologies for just over two years as a young software engineer. I've
                    already
                    worked on numerous projects during my brief stay there, and I helped manage one project for a
                    long-standing client of the company.</p>

            <h2>Country : India</h2>
            <p>India is a land of various cultures and a rich heritage. It is the seventh-largest country by area and
                the second-most populous country globally. The peacock is India’s national bird, and the Bengal tiger is
                the country’s national animal. The national song is named Vande Matram (written by Bankimchandra
                Chatterji). The Indian national song was first performed at the Indian National Congress in 1896. ‘Jana
                Gana Mana,’ India’s national anthem, is sung in 52 seconds. The national flag of India is named Tiranga,
                which is made up of three colours: saffron, white, and green, with the Ashoka Chakra in navy blue in the
                centre.</p>
